# VC Partners — Investment Policy Guidelines

*Internal Document — Last Updated: September 2025*

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines VC Partners' standard terms and policies for seed and early-stage investments. These guidelines represent our default positions and should be followed unless the Investment Committee approves specific exceptions.

All deal teams should reference this document when preparing term sheets. Deviations require written IC approval prior to term sheet issuance.

## 2. Economic Terms

### 2.1 Valuation Guidelines

| Round | Typical Pre-Money Range | Notes |
|-------|------------------------|-------|
| Pre-Seed | $2M - $6M | Exceptional teams only |
| Seed | $6M - $15M | Standard range |
| Series A | $15M - $40M | Requires revenue traction |

For valuations above these ranges, additional IC review is required.

### 2.2 Investment Size

- **Minimum check size:** $500,000
- **Maximum check size (seed):** $4,000,000
- **Target ownership:** 15-20% on a fully-diluted basis

We generally do not participate in rounds where we would hold less than 10% post-money.

### 2.3 Option Pool Requirements

**Standard policy: Option pool must be at least 15% of post-money fully-diluted capitalization.**

This is a firm requirement. We have seen too many portfolio companies struggle to attract talent with undersized pools. The pool should be:
- Unallocated at close
- Sized to cover 18-24 months of anticipated hiring
- Created pre-money (i.e., dilutes existing shareholders, not new investors)

Exceptions require IC approval and documented rationale.

### 2.4 Liquidation Preference

**Standard policy: 1x non-participating liquidation preference.**

We do not seek participating preferred. Our standard is "1x non-participating" meaning investors receive the greater of:
- (a) 1x their original investment, OR
- (b) Their pro-rata share as if converted to common

**Important:** We will not accept liquidation multiples above 1x. If the deal model or prior investors have negotiated >1x preferences, this must be flagged to the IC.

### 2.5 Dividends

**Standard policy: Non-cumulative dividends at 6% of the original purchase price, if and when declared by the Board.**

Dividends are not a priority for us at seed stage. However, we include the provision as standard protective language. The 6% rate is non-negotiable for deals under $5M in investment size.

For larger deals, we may accept "silent on dividends" language.

### 2.6 Anti-Dilution Protection

**Standard policy: Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution.**

We do not accept full-ratchet anti-dilution. Our term sheets should always specify broad-based weighted average adjustment in the event of a down round.

## 3. Control & Governance Terms

### 3.1 Board Composition

**Standard policy for seed investments:**

| Board Size | Investor Seats | Founder/Common Seats | Independent |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 3 seats | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| 5 seats | 2 | 2 | 1 (mutual) |

**For investments over $3M, we require 2 board seats or 1 seat plus 1 observer with full information rights.**

Our board representative must have:
- Full voting rights
- Attendance required for quorum
- Consent rights on reserved matters (see Section 3.3)

Board observer rights should be included regardless of whether we take a seat.

### 3.2 Information Rights

All investments must include:
- Monthly financial statements (within 30 days of month-end)
- Quarterly board updates with KPI dashboards  
- Annual audited financials (if revenue > $1M)
- Immediate notification of material events

### 3.3 Protective Provisions (Reserved Matters)

The following actions require investor consent:
- Changes to authorized shares or creation of senior/pari passu securities
- Amendments to charter documents affecting preferred rights
- Declaration of dividends
- Incurrence of debt > $100,000 outside ordinary course
- Related party transactions > $50,000
- Changes to board size
- Sale, merger, or liquidation of the company
- Changes to the option pool size

### 3.4 Drag-Along Rights

**Standard policy: Drag-along requires approval of:**
- (i) Board majority
- (ii) Majority of preferred shares
- (iii) Majority of common shares (excluding preferred-as-converted)

The common holder vote should explicitly exclude shares held by preferred holders voting as-converted. This carve-out is important and should be included in all term sheets.

### 3.5 Pro-Rata Rights

All investors holding at least 5% receive pro-rata rights on future financings. These rights:
- Apply to the next equity financing only (not debt)
- Are assignable to affiliates
- Terminate on conversion to common (IPO)

## 4. Founder & Employee Terms

### 4.1 Founder Vesting

**Standard policy: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff, monthly thereafter.**

- **Vesting commencement:** Date of closing, not company founding
- **Acceleration:** Single-trigger acceleration is not permitted; double-trigger may be negotiated
- **Credit for time served:** Generally not given; exceptions require IC approval

If founders have existing vested shares, we may require reverse vesting on a portion.

### 4.2 Founder Restrictions

All founders must agree to:
- **Non-compete:** 12 months post-departure (24 months in competitive sectors)
- **Non-solicit:** 24 months post-departure
- **IP assignment:** All prior and future IP assigned to company
- **Full-time commitment:** No outside employment without board consent

### 4.3 Good Leaver / Bad Leaver

We require clear definitions:
- **Bad Leaver:** Cause termination, resignation within 24 months, breach of restrictions
- **Good Leaver:** Death, disability, termination without cause, resignation after 24 months with board consent

Bad leaver treatment: Unvested shares forfeited; vested shares subject to buyback at lower of cost or FMV.
Good leaver treatment: Vesting ceases; vested shares retained.

### 4.4 Lock-up Provisions

Founders may not transfer more than 10% of their shares without investor consent until the earlier of:
- 3 years post-close
- A qualified financing of $10M+
- An exit event

---

## 5. Transaction Terms

### 5.1 No-Shop / Exclusivity

**Standard policy: 45-day exclusivity period from term sheet signing.**

During this period, the company may not:
- Solicit or encourage competing offers
- Provide confidential information to potential acquirers
- Engage in discussions regarding alternative financings

30-day exclusivity may be acceptable for very simple deals (< $1M) with no significant diligence.

### 5.2 Legal Fees

**Standard policy: Company pays investor legal fees, capped at $25,000.**

For complex transactions (multiple investors, international structure, significant negotiation), the cap may be increased to $40,000 with IC approval.

We use Wilson Sonsini as our preferred outside counsel. Founders may request alternative counsel but we reserve right of approval.

### 5.3 Closing Conditions

Standard conditions precedent:
- Satisfactory completion of legal due diligence
- No material adverse change
- Delivery of customary closing documents
- Board and shareholder approvals
- Founder employment agreements executed

### 5.4 Documentation

**Standard policy: Investor counsel drafts initial documents.**

We use our standard forms based on NVCA model documents. Company counsel reviews and comments. This approach:
- Reduces negotiation time
- Ensures consistency across portfolio
- Controls legal costs

## 6. Special Situations

### 6.1 Convertible Notes / SAFEs

When prior convertible instruments exist:
- Always include explicit conversion language in the term sheet
- Verify cap and discount terms before modeling
- Confirm whether conversion is into the current round or a shadow series
- Note: Our preference is shadow series conversion to maintain clean cap table

### 6.2 International Structures

For companies incorporated outside Delaware:
- Require US holding company (Delaware C-corp) prior to close, OR
- Obtain IC approval for alternative structure
- Additional legal fees budget required (typically +$15,000)

### 6.3 Bridge Financings

When leading a bridge into an existing portfolio company:
- Maximum 20% discount on next round
- Cap at 1.5x of current round's valuation
- Must include qualified financing threshold

## 7. Term Sheet Language Defaults

When drafting term sheets, use the following standard language unless otherwise directed:

### Participation Rights
> "1x non-participating. Upon a liquidation event, the Preferred shall receive the greater of (i) the original purchase price, or (ii) the amount such holder would receive if converted to common stock."

### Dividends  
> "Non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 6% of the original purchase price per annum, payable if and when declared by the Board of Directors."

### Anti-Dilution
> "Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection."

### Conversion
> "At holder's option at any time. Automatic conversion upon (i) IPO with proceeds of at least $30M and price of at least 3x the original purchase price, or (ii) consent of a majority of Preferred."

### No-Shop
> "For a period of 45 days following execution of this term sheet, the Company agrees not to solicit, encourage, or enter into discussions regarding any financing or acquisition transaction with any party other than the Investors."
