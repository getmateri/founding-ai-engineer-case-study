# Architecture

*Document your design decisions here.*

## Problem Decomposition

How did you break down the problem? What are the key subproblems?

## Agent Design

- What tools/capabilities does your agent have?
- What is the control flow?
- How do you manage context across steps?

## Automation Framework

- How do you decide what to automate vs. ask the user?
- What are your confidence thresholds and why?
- How do you handle the trade-off between speed and accuracy?

## Conflict Resolution

- How do you detect conflicts between sources?
- How are these surfaced to users?
- What's your hierarchy when sources disagree?

## Error Recovery

- How does the agent handle user corrections?
- What state is preserved vs. recomputed?

## Limitations & Future Work

- What did you cut for time?
- What would you do differently with more time?
- What would need to change to support other document types?
